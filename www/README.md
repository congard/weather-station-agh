# Weather Station frontend

A beautiful UI written in TypeScript using React and MUI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should also specify Weather Station's IP address while testing
> the frontend on your local machine.
> It can be done in the following way:
> ```bash
> REACT_APP_WS_BASE_URL="http://192.168.0.171" npm run start
> ```

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
